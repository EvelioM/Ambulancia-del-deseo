On the way to the hospital Kees made a detour to the port and was deeply moved by the immense happiness that Mario experienced. Then, Kees borrowed an ambulance from his company and arranged a route for the port of Rotterdam. He was surprised at how easy it had been for Mario to end his life in such a special way thanks to some simple phone calls. Just two months later, the Deseo Foundation was a reality.

    Today the Foundation has more than a hundred health volunteers with the knowledge and adequate preparation that make these wishes come true.',

This fact was announced in scoop, on April 20, 2018, during the I International Congress of Humanization of Emergencies, Emergencies and Catastrophes held in the City of Murcia (Spain, Europe).

    Since then, the team has expanded considerably to form what is now The Great Family of the Ambulance of Desire Foundation.
    
    We hope to continue fulfilling wishes thanks to the collaboration of all those who believe, like us, blindly in this project.',
